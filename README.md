#VIO initialization
The repository contains code another submodule which has been modified to
generate and save the following parameters :
- scale of monocular trajectory
- gravity estimate
- biases of accelerometer
- biases of gyroscope
- velocity of body.


These are the parameters required for initialization.
The iterative methods are generally applicable as they solve a bundle adjustment
problem.
